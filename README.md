# inconspicuous-ravioli
A Discord bot named "Chef Boiardee" that supplies images of Chef-Boyardee products. 
Definetly not connected to my HIVEMIND network.

In all seriousness, to the person who took advantage of my token slip-up: Why?
You could've done a huge amount more damage, being able to code a bot that deletes EVERY channel from EVERY server the bot is in THAT QUICKLY.
But no, you decide, "hey! I wanna see some random kid suffer for absolutely no reason." 
Good job. I hope you do the same on a business-sized scale one day. It'll be nice thinking about.
